Script to send auto messages on whatsapp web. Not implemented through Selenium.
Originally written to send timed memorandum on Whatsapp.

The script uses the library Pyautogui to move the cursor through the screen coordinates. The parameters may be changed for different laptops. This should work for a 13'' screen (tested on HP Spectre x360).

Some helpful comments are put in the code. Change parameters in order to adapt the script to different laptops and needs.
